# Probability of a fixed few-time coverage pattern

The relevant part of an admissible digest is its 26-bit index and its fourteen opened 10-bit leaf
coordinates.  For a fixed assignment of trees to distinct signing results, the successful tuples
are in bijection with one free index and one free leaf vector per signing result.
