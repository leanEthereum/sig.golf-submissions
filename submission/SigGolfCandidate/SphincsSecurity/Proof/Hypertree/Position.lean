# The positions of the honest key

Six of the eight hash domains name a structural position: a chain step, a one-time leaf, a node of a
layer's tree, a few-time leaf, a node of a few-time tree, and the hash of a forest's roots. Each has
one honest payload, built from the honest values at the positions below it, and the tweak determines
which position it is. The message digest and the encoding are the two that name none: their payload
is not a function of the key, and no honest value is defined at them.

`Position` is that index set, made finite by keeping the level and index fields inside the widths the
instance uses rather than in `Nat`. It over-approximates: a node above a short layer's root is a
position here and has no honest meaning, which costs nothing since every statement about positions is
either an inclusion or a count. What matters is that `parentOf` and `children` agree, since the
accounting charges a position's settling to its parent, and that no position has two parents.
