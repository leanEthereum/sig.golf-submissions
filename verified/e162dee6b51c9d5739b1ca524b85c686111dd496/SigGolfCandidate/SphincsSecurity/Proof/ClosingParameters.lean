# Where the two budget routes meet

`budgetSplit` is the budget at which the proof switches from the forced few-time games to the retained residual monitor. `primitiveCoefficient` bounds, per query below it, the one-time primitive events and the message work of the full certificate. Both are sealed; their values enter only `primitive_rates_small` and the closing arithmetic.
