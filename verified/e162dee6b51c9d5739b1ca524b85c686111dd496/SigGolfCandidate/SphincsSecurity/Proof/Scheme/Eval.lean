# Evaluating against a fixed answer function

The random oracle's support is characterized by total answer functions: a value comes out of the
lazy oracle exactly when some `f : QueryImpl HashSpec Id` agreeing with the cache evaluates the
computation to it (`exists_agreesWithFn_evalWithAnswerFn_eq_iff_mem_support`). So every structural
fact this development needs is a fact about `evalWithAnswerFn f`, where `f` answers each input the
same way however often it is asked and in whatever order.

That is what makes the shape of the algorithms tractable: under `evalWithAnswerFn f` a family of
independent computations may be assembled in any order, which is false at the level of
computations, `sequenceFin` fixing one.
