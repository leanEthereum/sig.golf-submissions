# sig.golf solution: SPHINCS+ with PORS+FP (forced-pruning single-tree few-time signature)

`S = 6100` bytes, `W = 6348` bytes, `K = 131072` bytes (cache), `C = 11907` cycles (verify bound
`11882` plus the witness charge `⌈6348 / 256⌉ = 25`). Layout (bytes): message 64, secret key 128,
public key 160, cache 19200, signature 13056, witness 2048.

The certificate is `SigGolfCandidate.certificateNew`. It is transferred from
`SigGolfCandidate.Final.certificate`, a certificate for the same images under the previous
organizer contract (70ba436, kept verbatim as `SigGolfCandidate.Legacy`): `SigGolfCandidate.Transfer`
proves that both contracts' machines and runs agree on admissible images and transfers each statement.
In the legacy certificate the four RISC-V images are proved to refine a byte-level reference
(`SigGolfCandidate.Ref`), which is proved equal to the abstract SPHINCS+ scheme with PORS+FP
(`SphincsSecurity`) up to the oracle input format; the abstract scheme's 127-bit event-form
security, per-seed completeness and correctness are transported to the organizer's game through
`SigGolfCandidate.Bridge`.
